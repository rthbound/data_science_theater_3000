lf you pass in an image, this API will run an optical character recoghition algorithm to extract any words or
sentences it can from the picture. lf you upload a PDF file, Word document, Excel spreadsheet or HTML file, it
will retum a plain text version of the content. Unlike most of the calls, this one takes its input in the standard
multipart form-encoded format thatâ€™s used when browsers upload files, rather than as JSON. lt retums any content
it finds as a stream of text.
